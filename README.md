# Go-Redis-caching


This project demonstrates a simple Go application for user management using Redis as a caching layer. It includes basic CRUD operations for storing and retrieving user data.

## Features

- **Add User**: Add a new user to Redis cache.
- **Get User**: Retrieve user details from Redis cache.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Go programming language (version >= 1.16)
- Redis server (version >= 5.0)
- Go Redis client package (`github.com/go-redis/redis/v8`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Set up Redis server:
   
   - Install Redis on your local machine or use a remote Redis server.
   - Ensure Redis is running and accessible.

3. Set environment variables:
   
   Set the following environment variables before running the application:

   ```bash
   export REDIS_ADDRESS="localhost:6379"  # Redis server address
   export REDIS_PASS=""                   # Redis server password (if required)
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

## Usage

### API Endpoints

- **POST /user**: Add a new user. Example:
  
  ```bash
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":"1","first_name":"John","last_name":"Doe","email":"john.doe@example.com"}' http://localhost:3000/user
  ```

- **GET /user/{id}**: Retrieve user details by ID. Example:
  
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000/user/1
  ```
